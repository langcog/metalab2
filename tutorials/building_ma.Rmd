===================

### How do I define my MA question?

### Why should I bother keeping track of the MA creation process?

alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

It is important that you build traceability of your work from the start,
particularly since in larger MAs other people may finish up the
work or you want to check later on why you decided to exclude a given
paper. So to make sure that all of your decisions are recorded and
clear, make a copy of this [*decision
spreadsheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtN4g6FddpBljQzrR-mS0y414M9wQNjK4Vz09nLOe2s/edit#gid=0).
Don’t forget to rename it, to give us a “viewing” link, and clean it up
as follows.

Step 1: Click on “File” and select the “Make a copy…” option

height="3.2031255468066493in"}

Step 2: In the window that appears, change the name to something like
“MA\_TOPIC"

![](media/image03.jpg){width="4.588542213473316in"
height="3.392189413823272in"}

Step 3: Click on the blue button “Share” on the top right.

Step 4: In the ensuing menu, click on “Get shareable link” on the top
right

Step 5: Copy the link and send it to us.

Step 6: Clean up

The model spreadsheet contains some fake entries and notes. Our
recommendation is, so as not to get confused, to remove the instructions
found on the top lines of each sheet and the fake information that is
already entered - except for a couple of exceptions: the pink columns
(A, B and W) in the Relevant\_studies\_search sheet contain formulas
that may be useful to you. So you might want to delete the contents of
the other columns and keep those two in order to reuse the formulas.

Additionally, make a copy of [*this
flowchart*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKY8BTZZ82bGyGwpGsyyzsilOqE1F1NcDLTKWtCe9AY/edit?usp=sharing),
rename and share as you did for your spreadsheet above. This figure
gives you an overview of the process, and you will be filling in the
boxes with the right numbers as you go along so that people who continue
this MA and/or those interested in assessing this work can make sure
that you followed the procedure.

### How do I select the studies to include ?
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=W3LMs-XY21g" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/W3LMs-XY21g/0.jpg" 
alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>

The goal of this step is to put together a list of publications that you
will look at (abstract only in step 3, and for a subset of those in full
in step 4) and consider for inclusion. In a typical MA, you make the
most comprehensive list possible in order to answer a specific research
question and/or to cover a given phenomenon. This typically means going
through 1,000 abstracts, and reading in full 100 papers.
You can start with the seminal paper for your effect of interest, and then look for the studies citing your seminal one. Use [pubmed’s search](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced) to find your pivot study’s entry, for instance by copy-pasting the full paper title in the builder:

![](https://github.com/langcog/metalab2/tree/master/images/tutorials/Pubmed_advanced_search.png)

When you press “search”, usually you’ll find the entry for your seminal paper (or if the title was not unique, you might need to click on one of the entries found until you do come across the entry for your seminal paper). Notice on the right a section entitled “Cited by …” Scroll down to click on the link at the bottom of this section stating “See all..”

You will now see all studies citing your seminal one. Constrain it further by clicking on “Show additional filters” on the left, and checking the box for “Infant: birth to 23 months”:



You now want to save all these papers in your reference management software. 
	If you use Zotero: Click on the drawing of a folder in your status/search bar. When you do so, a window will pop up with all the results for that pubmed page:

Click on “select all” and “OK”. Repeat for the other search pages. This will store the citation information, including abstract, in zotero.

You can also interrogate Pubmed with a script, such as [the one we have prepared](https://gist.github.com/mcfrank/c1ec74df1427278cbe53).

### Screen papers

In this step, you will go through the initial list you put together in
step 2, and make decisions to include/exclude papers, mostly based on
the abstract. In addition to creating your sample for data entry (step
4) you will start honing your *inclusion criteria*. Typically, these
will include:

-   **a homogeneous scientific question**: make sure you have clearly
    > defined the purview of e.g. cross-situational learning (e.g., this
    > name itself is vague to those outside the domain, so define it in
    > a more specific way: “exposure to sets of images paired with
    > wordforms with the goal of studying word-form image association,
    > but crucially multiple images are shown at once (unlike e.g. the
    > switch procedure)”)

-   **a homogeneous infant population**: typically-developing children,
    > between the ages of XX and YY (the precise ages may stem from your
    > seminal paper; perhaps to start with, you could set the maximum to
    > 36 months, the minimum to 0 months); consider whether you also
    > need to restrict the sample based on infants’ native language *on
    > theoretical reasons*

The last one is perhaps the trickiest. Staying close to your seminal
paper will allow you to reduce the amount of variation in your sample
due to methodological “details”, and to make it easier for yourself to
enter data, because all the results will be structured in similar ways.
But it’s important to know that this is a potential source of bias. For
instance, you could decide that you will only input data using a
specific kind of artificial language because you know that papers not
using this language have smaller effects. This will end up being a
self-confirmation exercise -- unless there are a priori strong
theoretical reasons to exclude other kinds of language /// to assume
that the learning algorithms attributed to the infant cannot be
generalized to these other languages.

Every time you make a decision regarding these and other key criteria,
remember to note it in your decision spreadsheet, in the last sheet
called “Notes\_inclusion”. For example, mine looks like this:

  **Question**                            **Decision**                                                                                                                                    **Date**
  --------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------
  **a homogeneous scientific question**   learning of speech sound categories, where the categories are represented by a multimodal versus unimodal distribution of acoustic correlates   10/19/2015
  **a homogeneous infant population**     typically-developing children, between the ages of 0 and 36 months                                                                              10/19/2015
  **a homogeneous procedure**             passive exposure in the lab, testing via any behavioral or non-behavioral method                                                                10/19/2015

Having explained the goal of this step, let us move on to how exactly
you could go about looking through your initial list and making
decisions. As before, we propose two potential routes, one without and
one with little programming.

***What if the title and abstract doesn’t allow me to decide?***

Then play it safe and include the paper to check based on the full text.

***What if the title and abstract doesn’t allow me to decide, but in
fact I know the paper and I know it needs to be excluded?***

Then you probably have already seen the full text of the paper, so say
“yes” for the screening decision, and then “no” for the full-text
decision.

### Decide on data structure for MA and create the spreadsheet

We are hoping that eventually all of these MAs may be included in
[*MetaLab*](http://metalab.stanford.edu), so we ask you to use the [*MA
template*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Y_2BcFSu48t0F8a_xrY1Ro2fJoCIV1h8O627WNcrjY/edit?usp=sharing)
(create a copy, as you did in step 1), and follow the [*coding
book*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1szXxrv75qTVx-4adlLrwmjWSDIBJfMH09dzh9733mog/edit?usp=sharing).
Ideally, you would code all potentially relevant moderator variables
(e.g., experimental manipulations) in addition to the core
characteristics (columns in red; e.g. means). However, in the interest
of time, you can get started with the core characteristics only.
Remember once more to give us viewing rights (see step 1 for
instructions).

### Retrieve and enter studies

In a typical full MA, you go through the whole list and only then start
entering. The procedure is as follows. Go back to your spreadsheet, and
for each study that has been decided as a “yes” during screening, try to
retrieve the full text for the paper as you normally would (e.g., search
through scholar.google.com; regular google; your institution’s library,
etc.) If you cannot retrieve it, update your spreadsheet sheet
Relevant\_studies\_search to mark this paper as “no” in column F
entitled “Fulltext\_retrieved”. If you want, you can contact the authors
to try to get the full text from them, in which case you can note this
on column G.

If you do find the full text, go through the paper to find the first
experiment reported. You will enter all experiments and conditions one
at a time, and fill in their information in the MA spreadsheet you
created in step 4.

IMPORTANT: You should work backwards from the **results** section: look
at what dependent measures are reported fully enough that you will be
able to extract an effect size from them. The following information
allows one to calculate an effect size (we are sticking to experimental
designs, since most of our MAs are experimental):

-   ****between-participant studies**: **Means and SDs (not SEs!) of the
    > dependent variable for each infant group** are all that is
    > required for the calculation of Cohen's d. Sometimes, means and
    > SDs are not available as numbers. If there are clear figures, you
    > can try to estimate means and SDs using** [**this online
    > app**](http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/)*. If you decide to
    > estimate values from figures, add a column to keep track of this.
    > Finally, **t or F values for the *main* effect in combination with
    > sample sizes** can be used to calculate Cohen's d. Note them
    > when available. *

-   ****within-participant studies**: Effect sizes for this type of
    > study are calculated the **same way as in between-participant
    > studies**, but in order to calculate the weight of these studies
    > the **correlation** between the first and second measurements is
    > required (to account for the amount of
    > within-participant variation). Since this measure is usually not
    > reported, we provide below median and range for correlations found
    > in existing MAs. **

    -   *Infant word segmentation from native speech: 0.641 (range:
        > 0.140 to 0.921)*

    -   *Infant vowel discrimination (native and nonnative): 0.496
        > (range: -0.413 to 0.855)*

At the beginning, we can help you decide what kind of experiment you are
looking at, and what kind of procedure you should follow.

When entering papers, please remember a key thing: all analyses are done
by machines, and machines cannot read text! So if a column is “numeric”,
please do ***not*** enter things that aren’t numbers (such as text,
spaces, \~, etc). This is particularly important for the dependent
measures!

At this stage, you might find that a given paper does not contain the
right information for being included. In this case, you can and should
exclude it. If you have already started entering it, you can leave the
information you entered and put in “comments” that the entry is
incomplete (although if you followed our advice above, you won’t have
wasted time entering it!). Remember to update your spreadsheet with each
paper you read and made a decision on.

If you have questions at this stage, please check our
[*FAQ*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_7mgeaARlYK6TecyUqzk9SSr0pLAkV3pQZE4qYT7CMA/edit?usp=sharing).
If you find your answer, great -- if not, tell us about it, and we’ll
answer you (and add it to the FAQ).

### 6. Calculate Effect Sizes

We use R to calculate effect sizes. For now, each MA does so
independently, see
[*https://github.com/christinabergmann/InWordDB/wiki*](https://github.com/christinabergmann/InWordDB/wiki)
for an example (not using the metalab template, though!).

We recommend the following for an introduction to effect sizes:

1\. Textbooks are great to get a basic overview of how to calculate
effect sizes. We consulted: Lipsey, M. W. & Wilson, D. B. (2001).
Practical meta-analysis. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.

2\. A great primer and a spreadsheet document to calculate effect sizes
by hand can be found via: D. Lakens. (2013). Calculating and Reporting
Effect Sizes to Facilitate Cumulative Science: A Practical Primer for
t-tests and ANOVAs . Frontiers in Psychology 4:863. Material:
[*osf.io/ixgcd/files/*](https://osf.io/ixgcd/files/)

3\. Since textbooks do not cover every possible question that different
meta-analysts may encounter, we turned to articles for more specific
questions. We found this article useful for considering the
comparability of effect sizes from within- and between-participant
designs: Morris, S. B., & DeShon, R. P. (2002). Combining Effect Size
Estimates in Meta-Analysis With Repeated Measures and Independent-Groups
Designs. Psychological Methods, 7(1), 1805-125. doi:
[*10.1037//1082-989X.7.1.105
